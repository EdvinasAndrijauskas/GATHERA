GATHERA - An app which will help people to gather around for different kind of activities, from sport to gaming or programming whatsoever. You will be able to create an event where other users can join for the activity.

I chose this app idea, because I feel that there is always lack of people when you need to gather a bigger group, so this app would make it easier to expand your friend list and have fun doing activities you like.

Should have requirements: 

- [ ] As a user, I want to follow interested categories
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to stop participating in the event

Could have requirements:

- [ ]  As a user, I want to get notifications before the event that I participate in starts
